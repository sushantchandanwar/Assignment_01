# 14. Python | Ways to find length of list


# method-1

n = len([10, 20, 30])
print("The length of list is: ", n)

# method-2

# using naive method

test_list = [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]

print("The list is : " + str(test_list))
for i in test_list:
    # incrementing counter
    counter = counter + 1

# Printing length of list
print("Length of list using naive method is : " + str(counter))

# method-3
